# Updated Extractors for Certificate Data

I've made several improvements to the certificate data extractors to better handle different markdown formats:

## Medical Tests Extractor

1. Added support for markdown tables in addition to HTML tables
2. Improved matching patterns to detect test listings in various formats
3. Added case-insensitive matching for better field recognition
4. Implemented a direct regex approach to find tests and their statuses
5. Added support for parsing tests from markdown list format

## Fitness Declaration Extractor

1. Added support for markdown list format like "- **FIT**: [x] Fit"
2. Improved pattern matching for HTML tables
3. Added section title matching for "Medical Fitness Evaluation" in addition to "Medical Fitness Declaration"
4. Standardized the output values to use camelCase format (fitWithRestriction, temporaryUnfit, etc.)

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

If further improvements are needed, consider:

1. Adding machine learning or statistical pattern matching to identify field patterns
2. Creating a pre-processing step that normalizes markdown formats before extraction
3. Adding more test data to validate against different document formats
4. Creating a mapping table for different possible field names across various documents

## How to Test the Changes

To validate the changes:

1. Process several different markdown formats through the updated extractors
2. Check if all expected fields are correctly populated
3. Verify that different check formats (âœ“, [x], etc.) are properly parsed
4. Test with different document languages and structures

Note: For testing, try both the structured markdown formats and more free-form formats.
